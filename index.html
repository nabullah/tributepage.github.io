            <h1>About Gandhi Ashram</h1>
            <p>On his return from South Africa, Gandhi’s first Ashram in India was established in the Kochrab area of
                Ahmedabad on 25 May 1915. The Ashram was then shifted on 17 June 1917 to a piece of open land on the
                banks
                of the river
                Sabarmati. Reasons for this shift included: he wanted to do some experiments in living eg farming,
                animal
                husbandry, cow breeding, Khadi and related constructive activities, for which he was in search of this
                kind
                of barren land;
                mythologically, it was the ashram site of Dadhichi Rishi who had donated his bones for a righteous war;
                it
                is between a
                jail and a crematorium as he believed that a satyagrahi has to invariably go to either place. The
                Sabarmati
                Ashram
                (also known as Harijan Ashram) was home to Mohandas Gandhi from 1917 until 1930 and served as one of the
                main centres
                of the Indian freedom struggle. Originally called the Satyagraha Ashram, reflecting the movement toward
                passive resistance launched by
                the Mahatma, the Ashram became home to the ideology that set India free. Sabarmati Ashram named for the
                river on which it sits, was created with a dual mission. To serve as an institution that would carry on
                a
                search for
                truth and a platform to bring together a group of workers committed to non-violence who would help
                secure
                freedom
                for India.</p>

            <p>
                By conceiving such a vision Gandhi and his followers hoped to foster a new social construct of truth and
                non-violence that would help to revolutionize the existing pattern of like.</p>

            <p> While at the Ashram, Gandhi formed a school that focused on manual labour, agriculture, and literacy to
                advance his efforts for self-sufficiency. It was also from here on the 12 March 1930 that Gandhi
                launched
                the famous
                Dandi march 241 miles from the Ashram (with 78 companions) in protest of the British Salt Law, which
                taxed
                Indian salt in an
                effort to promote sales of British salt in India. This mass awakening filled the British jails with 60
                000
                freedom
                fighters. Later the government seized their property, Gandhi, in sympathy with them, responded by asking
                the
                Government to
                forfeit the Ashram. Then Government, however, did not oblige. He had by now already decided on 22 July
                1933
                to disband
                the Ashram, which later became asserted place after the detention of many freedom fighters, and then
                some
                local citizens
                decided to preserve it. On 12 March 1930 he vowed that he would not return to the Ashram until India won
                independence.
                Although this was won on 15 August 1947, when India was declared a free nation, Gandhi was assassinated
                in
                January
                1948 and never returned.</p>

            <p> Over the years, the Ashram became home to the ideology that set India free. It aided countless other
                nations
                and people.Today, the Ashram serves as a source of inspiration and guidance, and stands as a monument to
                Gandhi’s life mission and a testimony to others who have fought a similar struggle. in their own battles
                against oppressive forces.</p>
